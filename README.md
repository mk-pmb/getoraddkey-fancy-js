getoraddkey-fancy
=================
If your collection is missing the slot you want to work with,
have it be created on the fly.

The kitchen sink edition supports async factory functions
and custom preconfiguration. If you prefer a leight-weight
approach, check out [getoraddkey-simple][goa-simple].

Inspired by [lodash feature request #2288](ld-is2288).
